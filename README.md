# USP Queue Bot

![logo](logo.png)

## Features

* Telegram Bot: [@uspqueuebot](https://telegram.me/uspqueuebot)

The USP Queue Bot simulates a physical queue that is managed using simple commands.
Users can join and leave the queue, while also keeping track of the queue length and their position in the queue.
Admins can also manage the queue by removing or bumping the first user in the queue.
The first few users in the queue would also be automatically informed as it is nearing their turn.
Responses from the bot are also in Singlish to keep the vibe fun and local.
Additionally, queue start and end timings can be added to signal the opening and closing of the queue. Users will only be unable to join and leave the queue before the start time, and after the end time. All other commands will still work.

## General Commands

### `/start`

Displays start message.

### `/help`

Displays help message with available commands.

### `/join`

Adds user into the queue.

### `/leave`

Removes user from the queue.

### `/howlong`

Displays the user's position in the queue and the overall queue length.

## Admin Commands

These commands would only work if the user is an admin.

### `/viewqueue`

Displays the entire ordered queue by usernames.

### `/next`

Removes the first person in the queue when they have been served.
The admin would be informed of the username of the user that is next in line.
The next few users would also be notified of their progress in the line.

### `/bump`

Bumps the first person in the queue by a few positions if they are late.
The admin would be informed of the username of the user that is next in line.
The next few users would also be notified of their progress in the line.

### `/purge`

Purges the entire queue.
Users in the queue will be notified of their removal from the queue.

### `/broadcast <message>`

Broadcasts a message to all users in the queue.

## Debugging

The following outlines the procedure for debugging.

1. In uspqueuebot/credentials.py, ensure `ADMIN_CHAT_ID` is accurate on line 4.
2. In uspqueuebot/main.py, change `DEBUG_MODE` to `True` on line 19.
3. In the command line, execute `severless deploy` or run `deploy.bat`.
4. From now on, all message metadata would be sent to the admin for debugging.
5. Users who sends messages to the bot will also receive an "under maintenance" response.
6. After debugging, change `DEBUG_MODE` in uspqueuebot/main.py back to `True`.
7. In the command line, execute `severless deploy` again.
